## General

When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where we use it to understand what our skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer.

## Data

The only data we collect is your Amazon Account email address. So we can create a user account. The user is important so we can get your personalized insights about your working time.

To improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

For some of our skills, it is necessary to save data for you in our databases. This data is only connected to your Alexa-UserId and Amazon Account email address but never to your name or any other personal information. 

## Changes

Our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes to the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
